*"It would appear that you are incapable of a sufficient level of comprehension necessary to permit meaningful communication."* - [ZAX 1.2](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/ZAX_1.2)

## What's this?
A collection of info and tools for reversing Fallout 1.

## Status ##
Since Fallout 1 has been almost 100% ported to the FO2 engine by [our merry group of Fallout fans](https://github.com/rotators), this project can be considered dead.

See https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2.

More recent research and documentation is available at https://fodev.net/files/fo2/ and https://github.com/rotators/fallout2-docs.
